Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Traffic Violation & Helmet Detection System 🚦🪖🚗  
Get ready to experience AI-driven detection for both traffic violations and helmet usage! With just a few easy steps, you’ll have this enhanced project up and running. Let’s get started!

🔧 Step 1: Install Anaconda  
Before diving into the code, ensure you have Anaconda installed on your system. Anaconda simplifies the process of managing environments and packages!

🛠️ Step 2: Update the Path  
In the project code, locate the following line:  
python file  
find = "C:/Your Path/Traffic Violation Detection"  
Replace it with the path where you stored the project folder. For example  
python file  
find = "C:/Coding/Projects/Traffic Violation Detection"

📂 Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory  
Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the folder where you have the project stored. You can do this by running:  
bash  
cd path_to_your_project_directory

🖥️ Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment  
Let’s set up a dedicated environment for this project! Run the following command to create a virtual environment with Python 3.8:  
bash  
conda create --name Vplatform python=3.8

🚀 Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment  
Activate your virtual environment with this simple command:  
bash  
conda activate Vplatform

📦 Step 6: Install Required Packages  
Time to install the necessary packages that power the project:  
bash  
conda install pillow  
conda install numpy  
conda install keras  
conda install tensorflow  
pip install opencv-python  
pip install imageio  
pip install imageio[ffmpeg]  
pip install imageio[pyav]  
# If using YOLOv5 for helmet detection, also run:  
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

⚡ Step 7: Run the Project  
Now, you’re ready to run the project! Simply execute the following command:  
bash  
python RunProject.py

🖼️ Step 8: Select the Input File  
When the project GUI appears, select the image or video file that you want to analyze for traffic and helmet violations.

✏️ Step 9: Set the Detection Boundary  
Mark the boundary in the GUI where the detection system should monitor violations.

🪖 Step 10: Helmet Detection  
The system will now also detect whether riders are wearing helmets. If a person is detected crossing the boundary **without a helmet**, their image will be saved as a violation.

⏳ Step 11: Wait for the Magic!  
Sit back and watch as the system processes the input and provides you with real-time detection results for both traffic violations and helmet usage!

💡 Pro Tip: For faster and more accurate detection, use optimized YOLO weights trained for both traffic objects and helmets. You can find or train such weights using public datasets.
